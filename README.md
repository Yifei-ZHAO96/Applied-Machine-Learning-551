# Applied-Machine-Learning-551 2019
Implementation of 4 mini-projects using different machine learning tricks including LR, LDA, Naive bayes, SGD, VGG, LeNet, AlexNet and deep neural work MelGAN

## Mini-project 1: Binary Classification for Wine Quality and Breast Cancer using Logistic Regression(LR) and Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
Implementation and evaluation of LR and LDA without using any API on _Wine Quality_ and _Breast Cancer Diagnosis_ datasets. 
Requirements of the project are available at: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject1_spec.pdf

## Mini-project 2: Reddit Comments Classification using Multinomial/Bernoulli Naive Bayes, LR, Linear SVM
Classification of 20 different categories of reddit comments using Bernoulli Naive Bayes without the help of any APIs. For performance comparison, other machine learning tricks including Multinomial Naive Bayes, LR, LDA,Linear SVM, etc., are used.
Requirements of the project are available at: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject2_spec.pdf

## Mini-project 3: Classification of the largest digit on a modified MNIST using VGG, LeNet, AlexNet
Implementation of VGG, LeNet and AlexNet on a modified MNIST.
Requirements of the project are available at: https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject3_spec.pdf

## Mini-project 4: Ablation Study on MelGAN
Reproducing chalenge track 2: modifing and conducting ablation studies on the MelGAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06711.pdf) based on the published code.
Requirements of the project are available at: https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject4_spec.pdf and https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/task/
